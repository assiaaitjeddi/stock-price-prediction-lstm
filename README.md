<h1 style="text-align:center;">LSTM Time Series Prediction</h1> 

This repository contains code for building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices based on historical data.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project aims to develop an LSTM-based model capable of accurately forecasting stock prices. The model leverages historical stock price data to predict future prices, enabling traders and investors to make informed decisions.

<h2>Features</h2>

- LSTM architecture for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data.
- Data preprocessing techniques to prepare the input data for model training.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the LSTM model.
- Visualization tools to analyze model predictions and compare them with actual observations.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock price data for a specific company. It includes features such as open, high, low, close prices, trading volume, and date-time information.
